1. Filtering:
   create an array of numbers, and filter only even numbers 
   create function which accepts array as parameter and return the filtered array.

   function filterArray(numbers){
        
        return something
   }

   //calling
   filterArray([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]); //result [2,4,6,8]

2. Mapping (create in the form of function)

    create an array of price list and create one more array which will apply 10%
    discount on all prices and form a new array.

3. Reducing:
   Create on array of ages and find the average of all ages using reduce method.

4. Combining
   Create an array of words and create new array from the same with only those words 
   whose length is more than 5 and also convert it into CAPITAL (upperCase)
   Hint: filter method, toUpperCase() method
