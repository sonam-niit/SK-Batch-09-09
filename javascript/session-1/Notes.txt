Javascript
------------------------

its scripting language, using that we can create dynamic page where the script is not visible in the browser, but will execute behind the scene and you can just see the output.

Browser load the script and will execute and the show you the output.

What is meaning of Dynamic Content?

Earlier the pages which we have created are the static pages, its just for showing simple content to the user but if user wants to interact with the page and while interacting you want to provide some effect to the user so for that we required JS.

like validation in the form


SONAM.FACULY@testbook.com ---> sonam.faculty@testbook.com

      sonam --> sonam

alert, confirmation pop up , propmt 

How to include Javascript to our HTML Page
------------------------------------------------
internal JS
------------------
<script>
   //write your code
</script>

External JS
--------------------------
create a seperate js file -- myscript.js

in html
<script src="myscript.js" ></script>


Variables
------------------------------
naming conventions
---------------------------

1.suggested to write variables name in lowercase, if more than one word then 2nd word first letter should be capital
	name
	firstName
	lastName
	mySimpleIntrest

2. no special characters allowed, space comma semicolon ? + = not allowed

	only _ and $ allowed

	a b -- not valid
	a-b -- not valid
	a.b -- not valid
	a%b -- not valid

	a_b -- valid
	$name -- valid
	a$b -- valid

3. name must start with alphabets, you can not start the variables names with digits.

	name -- valid
	number -- valid
	number1 -- valid
	number2 -- valid
	
	1number -- not valid
	2number -- not valid

4. its suggested to give a proper name to a variable rather than giving like a,b,x, y, z as a developres perspective.

Varible we have multiple datatypes
----------------------------------

few datatypes are called premitive datatypes(in built datatypes)

number
string
boolean -- true / false
null -- nothing considered as object
undefined - variable declared but not defined with any value.

Non-premitive datatypes called as user defined Datatypes
------------------------------------------------------------
Object
Array: 1D array, 2D array




To declare variables we can use more 2 keywords

let and const

the diffrence is 

let value we can change
const valued we can't change once its initialized (constant)

Let and const both are having a same scope which is block scope (once the block completed its deleted from the memory which we can't use)
var is having a functional scope means we can use it till function, outside the functions we can't access)
